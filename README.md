Testing CNNs

As a final project for the ACIT4530 (Data Mining at Scale) we were tasked to test different CNN models upon an X-ray dataset. We started by selecting tree different CNNs with the hope of getting different degrees of complexity as well as different design philosophies. We settled on testing AlexNet, Inception and DenseNet. 

We are aware that pre-trained models exist for these Networks. We though however, that coding them from scratch using the original publication as well as other aids would make the learning experience more enriching. We used a combination of PyTorch and Tensorflow/Keras to achieve this. All our code was written and tested in Google Colab.
